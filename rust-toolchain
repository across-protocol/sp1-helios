# This rust-toolchain file here is not a hard requirement. In theory, it can be used to pin down a
# rust toolchain version when generating an elf file from `program/` locally, but as per succinct's
# doc https://docs.succinct.xyz/docs/sp1/writing-programs/compiling , the recommended way to create
# reproducible builds is via `--docker` flag instead.
